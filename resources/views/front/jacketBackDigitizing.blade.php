<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Sequencing & Transitions </b>
<br>For multi-hoop projects, artwork sequenced across hoops requires mindful trimming, tie-offs and color transitions to prevent visible jumps between embroidered patches.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Pre-Production Analysis </b>
<br><br>Using provided jacket materials, we test digitized outputs to fine-tune sizing, positioning and graphic integration before final delivery.
