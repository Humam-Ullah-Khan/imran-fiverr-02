<h3 style="color:#103399;">Pricing </h3><p>

With 20 years of apparel embroidery expertise, Digitizing Direct offers specialized digitizing converting artwork files into mesmerizing, production-ready designs guaranteed to elevate any fabric.
<br><br>Understanding every project differs, we offer fully customized digitization strategies precisely tailored to tackle each client’s unique needs.
<br><br>Here is an overview of our flexible, value-packed pricing structure across key offerings:

</p><br>


<h3 style="color:#103399;">Emblem & Patch Digitizing</h3><p>


Ideal for varsity team sports patches, corporate logos or personalized embroidery with vibrant density variations, our patch and emblem digitizing cost varies based on:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Complexity </b> – The more intricate an artwork or higher the stitch count, pricing is higher to account for specialized techniques, underlays etc. Discounts apply for simpler designs.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Size </b> – We charge per thousand stitches so small or condensed logos have lower stitch volumes and are more affordable than say full jacket back designs translating into exponentially higher stitch counts.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Color Sorting </b>– For multi-color designs, intricacy of color separation process impacts pricing, so more color changes means more digitizing time and hence higher rates.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Output File Formats </b> – Extra file preparation needed for certain formats like pre-sequenced multi-hoops have small premiums while base embroidery files have lower charges.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Rush Orders </b> – Our standard digitizing timelines range 2-4 days but for urgent deliveries needed in 24 hours, expedited fees apply to allocate additional resources.





<h3 style="color:#103399;">3D Foam & Puff Digitizing </h3><p><br>

For dazzling dimensional design effects on jackets, bags, caps and fashion apparel, this specialized service cost varies based on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Number of Elements – More intricate puff motifs or larger puff sections have higher stitch volumes that impact pricing so fewer simpler elements means more affordability.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Height Specifications – The more pronounced the puff height needed, the greater the digitizing intricacy to prevent fabric overly stretching or results looking boxy. Hence taller puffs cost slightly more.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Effect Complexity – If puff elements incorporate additional components like gradients or specialty fills for more visual dynamism, the cumulative process intricacy gets factored into pricing.

</p><br>



<h3 style="color:#103399;">Vector Art Conversions </h3><p><br>

Our flawless embroidery logos find widespread applications across:

To transform logo vector files, digital illustrations or typography into refined embroidery files, our vector digitizing rates vary based on:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Path Simplicity – Highly convoluted overlapping paths with multiple anchor points take more digitizing work so get charged higher over simpler, streamlined vector paths.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Effect Inclusions – Gradients, drop shadows and other vector effects need additional software skills during embroidery translation so include premiums. Cleaner vectors have lower pricing.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Output Format – Requesting production-ready vector files sequenced for multi-hooping may carry nominal additional format charges over basic machines files meant just for sampling.

</p><br>


<h3 style="color:#103399;">Sequin Embellishment Digitizing </h3><p><br>

For glam sparkling accents on apparel, display backdrops and accessories, pricing is contingent on:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Quantity – More sequins concentrated within embroidery files require greater software processing power and expertise, so our charges correlate to volumes embedded plus needed color sorting intricacy.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Size – Miniature sequins stay flat with higher surface coverage. In contrast, larger sequins need specialized digital molds for accent dimension so size impacts pricing too.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Shape – For custom sequin designs, extra software skills are essential to form circular, teardrop and other tailored outlines to complement overall embroidery aesthetics at shaped sequin premiums.

</p><br>





<h3 style="color:#103399;">Applique Design Digitizing</h3><p>

To precisely outline fabric patches for neat fills or accent insulating foam shapes perfectly, our applique digitizing rates vary depending on:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Layer Density – More complex multi-layer appliques demand higher digitizing expertise to tackle fabric positioning, stitch alignment and patch sequencing without gaps so have appropriately higher pricing over simpler single layer appliques.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Material Types – Smooth satins drape and pose differently over stitch lines versus thick layered felt or leather where special fabric compensation techniques come into play impacting digitizing rates.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Edge Finishing – While basic satin stitch finishing has nominal charges, specialized techniques like laser-cut scalloping or unique edge shaping means much more digital manipulation and correspondingly higher pricing.
And for other services like full jacket back designs, gradient effects, 3D mascots or multi-hooping breakdowns – do reach out with your creative vision for fully personalized quotes!
