With decades of combined digitizing experience under our belts, our specialized logo digitizers adhere to proven techniques and guidelines to deliver outstanding results:
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>Initial Concept Finalization </b>
<br><br>We first analyze your existing logo artwork, standard embroidery formats like machine-readable PES, DST files and applique if required. This stage focuses on finalizing size, dimensions, placement guidelines, colors and special stitch requirements you may have.

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•<b>	Testing & Approvals </b>
