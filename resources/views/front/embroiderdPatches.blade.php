<h3 style="color:#103399;">Our Patch Digitizing Process</h3><p>


Leveraging decades of apparel embroidery experience, our detailed process delivers exceptional patch quality:
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>	Design Analysis </b>
We carefully evaluate artwork complexity, dimensions, colors, fabric types, border and placement preferences to device customized digitization techniques.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>		Size Mapping </b>
Based on manufacturing scales, we strategically map digitized elements to fit patch dimensions precisely including borders and edge trims.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>		Border Details </b>
Patch borders make or break an outstanding design. Our precise satin stitch borders neatly finish raw fabric edges for clean professionalism.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>		Color Partitioning </b>
For multi-colored designs, we expertly separate color segments and provide fabric specific thread color codes for hassle-free manufacturing.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>		Underlay Configurations </b>
Essential for design longevity, we incorporate customized underlays below dense areas to prevent puckering and maintain structural integrity with repeated washes.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>		Overlap Elimination </b>
Where design elements meet or overlap, our digitizers ensure stitch mechanics prevent gaps for seamlessly integrated motifs.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	<b>		Post-Production Checks </b>
We carefully hand-stitch test patch files on multiple fabric types including twill, wool, canvas etc. to guarantee real-world quality.

Our patch digitizers understand that technique requirements vary based on material types. That’s why our digitization process can be fully customized for different fabrics:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Wool & Felt – We alter underlay to account for fabric thickness and density so designs hold shape through repeated wash and wear.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Twill & Canvas – Underlays are embedded to support stitch integrity across the uneven fabric surface without puckering or boxiness.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Satin & Silk – Specialty fill patterns and strategic stitch spacing help designs gracefully drape over sleek fabrics.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Leather & Denim – For tough materials, we tweak pull compensation to counter digitized design shrinkage from repeated abrasion and wear.
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•	Specialty Fabrics – From sequins to reflective prints, our software tricks adapt designs for unique fabric needs.
